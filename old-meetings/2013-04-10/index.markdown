Dear Neuroscientists in the Vienna Area,

We cordially invite you and your group members to the second
‘Neuroscience Vienna Network’ meeting at IST Austria on Wednesday
April 10th. We will start at 4pm with four talks (20min+5min
questions). After the talks we will have a poster session with
accompanying light dinner. We thus solicit abstracts until March
20th. Please include a title, authors and abstract body. We will
choose the speakers from the submitted abstracts and thus strongly
encourage especially students/postdocs to submit their best work! We
hope for as many contributed abstracts to stimulate interactions and
discussions between students, postdocs and the group leaders during
the poster session.

Please forward this e-mail to the members of your group and encourage
them to participate. You are also encouraged to forward this email to
other potentially interested parties, and note that we are not strict
about the definitions of "Vienna" or "Neuroscience".

Please register by March 20, 2013 at:
http://ist.ac.at/news-media/meeting-registration/ Note that you also
need to register if you will not present a poster or intend to give a
talk. We need to know exact numbers for organizational purposes.

For updates and information consult

We look forward to seeing you on Wednesday April 10th at IST Austria,
Gašper Tkačik and Simon Hippenmeyer
